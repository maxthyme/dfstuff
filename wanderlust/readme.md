Updated to include improvements to layering and coverage based on the ideas in Stal's Armoury, more tweaking of weapon balance/feel, and an overhaul of the dwarf/dorf subspecies into a caste system to allow dwarf/dorf, human/hurf, and elf/erf as options for play. Included is an adjustment to the essence of fortitude which adds an interaction to turn into any of the three improved material castes. Goblins already start out with the strong material template, incidentally.

Added skulls and versions of the improved bone materials to allow things like dragon skull helms or goblin skull war hammers. The relevant creatures have an added reaction class used with the bone helm reaction, and the regular material castes of the first three races produce the ordinary products when butchered finally.

A mod which incorporates the general style of the DF Wanderer mod into the vanilla file layout, along with my own personal tweaks and additions like an expansion of the balm system.

Intended to be plug-and-play with vanilla, simply dropping these files over the regular vanilla files is all that is required.
