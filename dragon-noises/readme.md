Originally this began as part of DF Wanderer.

I tweaked the balm buffs and made different megabeasts give different buffs.
I also upgraded the bones to be copper/semimega, iron/mega, and steel/dragon.
All in all it gives significantly more threatening megabeasts, the combined final balm
gives a reason to go hunt down all of the different types, and the improved bone 
properties give you progressively better and better gear, assuming you're smart and
don't try to jump straight for a dragon or hydra asap, in which case you get to reroll
and go find your corpse. :D
