Originally this began as part of the awesomely fun DF Wanderer mod by Deon (itself an homage to the Wanderer's Friend as I recall) and naturally won't work right without it.

I tweaked the balm of strength and balm of power buffs, and then added in three more so Rocs, Dragons, and Hydras all give different buffs, with the balm of power being a stack of all the lesser ones with a cherry on top. Don't ask me why I made hydras give a balm of wisdom... lots of heads I guess? I was sleepy.

I also upgraded the bones to be equivalent to: copper -> semimega, iron -> mega, and steel -> dragon/hydra.

All in all it gives significantly more threatening megabeasts, which is worth it by itself, honestly. I got bored with glass cannon dragons pretty quickly, getting maimed by them is far more fun. 

Additionally the combined/stacked buffs of the balm of power gives a reason to go hunt down all of the different ways to get maimed, and the improved bone properties give you progressively better and better gear to hack from their bones and hide, assuming you're smart and don't try to jump straight for a dragon or hydra asap, in which case you get to reroll and go find your corpse. :D
