stuff for df

Mostly adventurer relevant, though prefchange is actually only handy in fortress mode, I made it so I could force specific pieces of artifact gear with a quicky reclaim group and then either grab one of them or have them drop the gear off at a nearby site and pick it up with an adventurer.

The rest is either some personal changes to the DF Wanderer mod I play with and think are fun enough to share, and a way to do stupid things after maxing out an adventurer and realizing they can withstand being literally skipped across an ocean if you're hopped up on enough megabeast heart drugs.
