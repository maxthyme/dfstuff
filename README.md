stuff for df

Mostly adventurer relevant, though prefchange is actually only handy in fortress mode, I made it so I could force specific pieces of artifact gear with a quicky reclaim group and then either grab one of them or have them drop the gear off at a nearby site and pick it up with an adventurer.

Now includes my very first mod: wanderlust, which is based heavily on the DF Wanderer mod by Deon, except folded back into the vanilla file layout with my own changes and a couple additions like the expanded balm upgrades.
